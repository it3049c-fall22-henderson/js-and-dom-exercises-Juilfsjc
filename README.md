I found it very interesting to learn about arrays as I had always been scared to learn how to use them as they are complicated but after learning how to use them here I feel more confident with using them and see the value that they can add to your code.

### How long it took you to finish this?
About 1 hour, I forgot to push my changes to github desktop as I was working so I committed them all at the end.
